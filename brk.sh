########################################################################
#
# Description : --------------------------------------------------------
#
# Purpose of bash script is to create backup and or restore of your keyring
# directory. Backup creating tar archives of whole keyring directory.
# Restore is interactive. Script also ensure clean old backups and left
# latest one.  
#
# [!IMPORTANT]
# Path to the keyrings is hardcoded and points to the directory:
# $HOME/.local/share/keyrings
# If your system is different setup, you have to modify line 99
# according to. The line is following:  
# export HOME_KEYRINGS=$HOME/.local/share/keyrings
#
#
# Installation : -------------------------------------------------------
#
# Installation require privileged rights of user.
# In terminal go to the directory you downloaded script, setup executable
# flags and call installation itself:
# cd /<path to downloaded script>
# chmod a+x brk.sh
# ./brk.sh --install
#
# Once successfully installed, in system will be available new following
# commands:
# - backup-keyrings
# - restore-keyrings
# - clean-backup-keyrings
#
#
# Uninstallation : -----------------------------------------------------
#
# Uninstallation of script require privileged rights of user.
# In terminal run any of available command of script with an argument
# -u or --uninstall, for example:
# backup-keyrings -u
# 
# This ensure script and commands will be removed from system.
# 
#
# Backup of keyrings : -------------------------------------------------
#
# In terminal execute:
# backup-keyrings
#
# This create compressed tar archive of whole keyring directory.
#
#
# Restore of keyring(s) : ----------------------------------------------
#
# In terminal execute:
# restore-keyrings
#
# This check all available backups of keyrings and offer which one do you
# need to restore. Restore is interactive, you will be prompted for:
# 1. backup from where you need to restore
# 2. content of backup you need to restore
#
# If you need restore all content from latest backup simply hit enter twice.
#
#
# Clean backup of keyrings : -------------------------------------------
#
# In terminal execute:
# clean-backup-keyrings
#
# Purpose of the command is to remove unnecessary old backups which is
# usually no longer required. The command only ask if you really need to
# clean old backups and left only latest one in system.
